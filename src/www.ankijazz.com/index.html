      <h1>About AnkiJazz</h1>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.ankijazz.com">AnkiJazz<img src="img/anki-logo16x16.png"></a> provides generated, high quality, and carefully reviewed (thanks
        to <a href="http://www.marcusarmani.de/">Marcus</a>) <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki<img src="img/anki-logo16x16.png"></a> cards related
        to Music (and Jazz in particular).
      </p>
      <h2>About Scales</h2>
      <p>
        Decks contain scales which are most commonly used in Jazz:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Major Scale and all of its modes</li>
        <li>Harmonic Minor and its Phrygian Dominant mode</li>
        <li>Melodic Minor and its Lydian Dominant and Altered modes</li>
        <li>Half/Whole Diminished with its only Whole/Half Diminished mode</li>
        <li>Whole Tone Scale which has no modes</li>
        <li>Other scales and modes are omitted</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Melodic Minor refers to "Jazz Melodic Minor", which means it is the same in both directions, ascending and
        descending.
        In classical music, the descending melodic minor is the same as natural minor, but not in here (in Jazz).
      </p>

      <h2>About Cards</h2>
      <h4>Variants</h4>
      <p>
        Some decks have multiple variants. The "Guitar" version contains 6 variants of every card:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Play ascending in low fretboard position</li>
        <li>Play descending in low fretboard position</li>
        <li>Play ascending in medium fretboard position</li>
        <li>Play descending in medium fretboard position</li>
        <li>Play ascending in high fretboard position</li>
        <li>Play descending in high fretboard position</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Ordering</h4>
      <p>
        Anki cards are ordered by difficulty, where difficulty is e.g. number of accidentals but also some other
        criteria.
        So, you probably don't want to configure Anki to show cards in random order (unless you really want to).
        BTW, the ordering contains some randomness, so some challenges may pop-up earlier than you'd expect.
      </p>
      <h4>Fields and Tags</h4>
      <p>Instead of tags, several fields are provided to create <em>Filtered Decks</em>. If, for example, you just want
        to practice Major Scales, you can create a filtered deck with the condition
        <code>ModeTypeName:"Major Scale"</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>About Key Signatures</h2>

      <h4>Bb vs F#</h4>
      <p>Bb and F# refer to the same major scale because of their enharmonic equivalence. 
        Whether a scale should be notated as Gb of F# depends on the context, both notations are valid and commonly used. 
        So, in AnkiJazz I usually notate both of them which results in 13 different notations for the 12 keys. 
        Higher-order enharmonic equivalences like C# or Cb are omitted.
      </p>

      <h4>Modes of Major Scales</h4>
      <p>There are no agreed-upon rules as to which key signature to use for a scale like D-Dorian (which is the second mode of C-Major). Many sources on the
        internet recommend to use the key signature of the parent-scale C-Major because D-Dorian and C-Major
        share the same notes.
        But others, like the German "Jazz-Bible" <a href="https://en.schott-music.com/shop/jazz-harmony-no326750.html">Jazz Harmony by Frank Sikora</a>
        recommend to notate all minor scales (including Dorian) with the key signature of their parallel natural minor 
        (where "parallel" means: "same root", not to be mixed with "relative" which means: "same signature"), 
        e.g. notate D-Dorian with key signature of F-Major because the relative minor of F-Major is D natural minor.
      </p>
      <p>
        In AnkiJazz, I notated a mode using the key signature of the parent-scale that the mode was derived from.
        To me it is more important to see what key-center I'm in, instead of being aware of how the current mode differs
        from its parallel minor/major.
        For example, if chords in a major II-V-I progression change quickly, I want to see whether all three modes share
        the same notes.
        Or in other words, for modes of the major scales, I chose a key signature that includes all necessary
        accidentals so that no more "extra-accidentals" are needed within the notation (in front of individual notes).
      </p>

      <h4>Modes of Melodic/Harmonic Minor</h4>
      <p>
        For Melodic Minor and Harmonic Minor, there is no key signature that contains all accidentals
        for these scales, some "extra-accidentals" are always required. But the number of "extra-accidentals" can be
        minimized:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Melodic Minor is notated with the key signature of its parallel Dorian scale.
          In other words, Melodic Minor is notated as Dorian with a raised 7th (and that is the way I "see" Melodic
          Minor). Note that this differs from the notation described in e.g. on <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Key_signature">Wikipedia</a>
          which recommends to notate Melodic Minor with the key signature of its parallel Natural Minor scale.
        </li>
        <li>
          Harmonic Minor is notated with the key signature of its parallel Aeolean (Aeolean = Natural Minor) scale.
          In other words, Harmonic Minor is notated as Aeolean with a raised 7th
          which conforms to the notation described in e.g. <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Key_signature">Wikipedia</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Oddities</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Some scales require an "enharmonic root", e.g. the 7-th mode of F# Major is E# Locrian (and not F Locrian
          because Gb and F# are both valid key signatures for the same scale).</li>
        <li>Scales like G Melodic-Minor or D Harmonic-Minor can only be notated by using both, sharps # and flats b.
        </li>
        <li>Other scales like Db Harmonic <em>Major</em> require double flats, and e.g. G# Harmonic Minor requires
          double sharps</li>
        <li>Whole Tone scale and Diminished scales are notated in the key of C using flats - there is no other
          agreed-upon key signature for these scales.</li>
      </ul>
