        I'm a professional software developer and a hobby musician. AnkiJazz is not a company, it's just my pet project.
        Initially I created the Anki decks for myself, but then I thought they might be useful for others too.

        Your feedback is very much appreciated. Especially if you find an error or something odd, please let me know
        (and that is perfectly ok, I'm a human programmer making errors all the time).
        You can send an email to <em>mail [at] ankijazz.com</em> to contact me personally or leave a post
        in the <a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/ankijazz-shared-decks/6642" target="_blank">Anki forum</a>.
